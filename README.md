I have reviewed the existing JavaScript code. It was throwing several errors preventing the code from even running but I have fixed all the critical issues, as well as do a full audit to the code. The goal was to highlight areas where improvements can be made to performance, readability and future maintainability. This was a challenging task but also a fantastic opportunity for me to gain experience as a junior developer.I have showcased my skills and demonstrated my ability to trouble shoot and improve the existing code. I spent a week digging into the codebase and compiled the recomendations into a slideshow to be presented to the team at the end of the week
I used Visual studio code and GitHub to fix all the errors of the code.
